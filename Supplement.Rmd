## 1. Posthumous care by mother

![](Plots/fuzz_event_cropped.png)

Figure S1. A mother caring showing poshumous care by defending it from others, moving it in and out of the den, and grooming it. Note the atypical way she is carrying her cub in panel A; cubs are typically carried by the nape of the neck, as in other carnivores. When observers left her, she was sleeping next to the body of her deceased cub (panel E).

## 2. Model detail and diagnostic for mortality \~ age at death

Here we used a multinomial model of mortality source as a function of age at death to understand the contribution of different mortality sources to overall mortality. This model was initialized with weak, uninformative priors, and four chains were run for 30000 iterations each (15000 warmup).

```{r age at death model - summary}

# Priors
prior_summary(fit)

summary(fit)

```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

```{r age at death interval plot, echo = FALSE}

mcmc_intervals(fit, regex_pars = 'age', prob_outer = 0.95)
```

Figure S2. Interval plot showing parameter estimates and associated 50% and 95% credible intervals for the effect of age at death on the probability of different mortality sources. Infanticide is the reference level, so parameter estimates represent the log odds ratio of each mortality source relative to infanticide.

## 3. Model detail and diagnostic for moratlity \~ prey density

Here we used a multinomial model of mortality source as a function of prey density. This model was initialized with weak, uninformative priors, and four chains were run for 30000 iterations each (15000 warmup).

#### Model summary and diagnostic

```{r prey model - summary}

# Priors
prior_summary(prey_mod)

summary(prey_mod)
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

```{r prey density interval plot, echo = FALSE}

mcmc_intervals(prey_mod, regex_pars = 'prey_density', prob_outer = 0.95)
```

Figure S3. Interval plot showing parameter estimates and associated 50% and 95% credible intervals for the effect of prey density on the probability of different mortality sources. Infanticide is the reference level, so parameter estimates represent the log odds ratio of each mortality source relative to infanticide.
