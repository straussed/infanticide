## 1. Posthumous care by mother

![](Plots/fuzz_event_cropped.png)

Figure S1. A mother showing posthumous care for her cub that suffered infanticide. She defended it from others, moved it in and out of the den, and groomed it. Note the atypical way she is carrying her cub in panel A; cubs are typically carried by the nape of the neck, as in other carnivores. When observers left her, she was sleeping next to the body of her deceased cub (panel E).

## 2. Model detail for mortality \~ age at death

Here we used a multinomial model of mortality source as a function of age at death to understand the contribution of different mortality sources to overall juvenile mortality. This model was initialized with weak, uninformative priors, and four chains were run for 30000 iterations each (15000 warmup). To determine convergence, we visually examined rank plots of MCMC chains (not pictured) and confirmed that the potential scale reduction factor (R-hat) was less than 1.1 (in all cases R-hat < 1.001). 

```{r age at death model - summary, echo = FALSE}

model_summary(fit)
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

```{r age at death interval plot, echo = FALSE}

mcmc_intervals(fit, regex_pars = 'age', prob_outer = 0.95)+xlab('Parameter estimate')
```

Figure S2. Interval plot showing parameter estimates and associated 50% and 95% credible intervals for the effect of age at death on the probability of different mortality sources. Infanticide is the reference level, so parameter estimates represent the log odds ratio of each mortality source relative to infanticide.

## 3. Model detail for mortality source \~ prey density

Here we used a multinomial model of mortality source as a function of prey density in the month before death. This model was initialized with weak, uninformative priors, and four chains were run for 30000 iterations each (15000 warmup). To determine convergence, we visually examined rank plots of MCMC chains (not pictured) and confirmed that the potential scale reduction factor (R-hat) was less than 1.1 (in all cases R-hat < 1.001).

  xlab('Parameter estimate')
```

Figure S3. Interval plot showing parameter estimates and associated 50% and 95% credible intervals for the effect of prey density on the probability of different mortality sources. Infanticide is the reference level, so parameter estimates represent the log-odds ratio of each mortality source relative to infanticide.

## 4. Model detail for mortality \~ cub density

Here we used a multinomial model of mortality source as a function of cub density at the communal den. This model was initialized with weak, uninformative priors, and four chains were run for 30000 iterations each (15000 warmup). To determine convergence, we visually examined traceplots of MCMC chains (not pictured) and confirmed that the potential scale reduction factor (R-hat) was less than 1.1 (in all cases R-hat < 1.001).
